## 

> **"Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. - Habakkuk 2:2"**

## The call.

I have always been full of Ideas and new ways to approach problems, and over the years it became common for me to call my grandmother to share all of the ideas that were almost literally burning in my chest. The ideas would fly out but I continuously had a hard time focusing on any one project or Idea. Something my grandmother started to quote to me was  **Habakkuk 2:2. "Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it."** It took a few more years of repeating but in the last 12 months of my live this scripture has played out in a big way. 

## The why.

I want to accomplish a few things simultaneously with this blog. I want to enforce some personal disicpline by forcing myself to be consistent, document my journey here for others to read, and document my progress, so that I can use these posts as a measuring tool. There is something divine about writing down your thoughts and plans.  I have also always admired individuals that not only create cool things but are also able to document the process and make the vision in their head plain on paper that can later be easily consumed by readers.

## The result.

The immediate results of the points outlined above are the Genesis of this blog. This blog is a starting point for me and Im excited very excited to become a little more structured and disciplined along this journey.

I will be blogging about my spiritual, physical, and mental progress. \

So welcome!

And Enjoy!
